# React Portfolio

## Description

This is my official portfolio, built using React. It includes links to projects I've worked on, photos and information about me, a way to contact me and links to follow me on social media!

There is also a light/dark mode toggle and a Comments section where visitors can leave a comment on my portfolio that uses Google Firebase to save the comments to the page. As admin (logged in), I can see delete buttons on each comment for easily removing comments if it gets too cluttered.

## Roadmap

I will continue to update this portfolio as I create and work on new things. Currently the Dungeon Mate project deployed link goes no where because this is our project 3 and will be done + presented on October 10th thus I will update. (The GitHub repo link still works)

I may update photos, color schemes and other misc things as I learn new things in my development journey.
