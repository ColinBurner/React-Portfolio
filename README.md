# React Portfolio

## Description

This is my official portfolio, built using React. It includes links to projects I've worked on, photos and information about me, a way to contact me and links to follow me on social media!

There is also a light/dark mode toggle and a Comments section where visitors can leave a comment on my portfolio that uses Google Firebase to save the comments to the page. As admin (logged in), I can see delete buttons on each comment for easily removing comments if it gets too cluttered.

## Usage

Upon first load you will see an about me page with information about me as a developer and a human being accompanied by an image of me and my cat Ragnar! When you click a nav link in the header, you will be taken to that specific view.

The page you are on will be highlighted in the navbar.

Under Projects you have links to github repositories and deployed applications that I have worked on in the past.

Under Contact you have a form you can fill out in order to send me a message directly to my email!

Under Resume there is a link that currently goes to Google.com but will eventually lead to my resume when I create/update it along with my proficiencies as a developer.

Under Photos you will see some fun photos of me, my son and my cats!

In the Header you have the option to toggle light/dark mode, your browser will remember your selection.

Under Comments you will be able to leave a named or anonymous comment in the form of a random sticky note on my portfolio so don't be afraid to let me know what you like or don't like about my portfolio!

## Roadmap

I will continue to update this portfolio as I create and work on new things. Currently the Dungeon Mate project deployed link goes no where because this is our project 3 and will be done + presented on October 10th thus I will update. (The GitHub repo link still works)

I may update photos, color schemes and other misc things as I learn new things in my development journey.
