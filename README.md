## Usage

Upon first load you will see an about me page with information about me as a developer and a human being accompanied by an image of me and my cat Ragnar! When you click a nav link in the header, you will be taken to that specific view.

Under Portfolio you have links to github repositories and deployed applications that I have worked on in the past.

Under Contact you have a form you can fill out in order to send me a message directly to my email!

Under resume there is a link that currently goes to Google.com but will eventually lead to my resume when I create/update it along with my proficiencies as a developer.

Under Photos you will see some fun photos of me, my son and my cats!

## Roadmap

I will continue to update this portfolio as I create and work on new things. Currently the Dungeon Mate project deployed link goes no where because this is our project 3 and will be done + presented on October 10th thus I will update. (The GitHub repo link still works)

I may update photos, color schemes and other misc things as I learn new things in my development journey.
