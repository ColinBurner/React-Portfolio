          Welcome! I am Colin Taaffe and I created this portfolio in the U of M coding bootcamp! I am a father, an avid gamer and I have 3 cats (Ragnar is the one pictured!) 
          I have been interested in web development since the days of adjusting my own HTML on MySpace. 
          I spent almost 20 years working in production/warehouse management before finally deciding it was time to find a career that I felt fulfilled me.
